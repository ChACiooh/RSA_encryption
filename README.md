# Computer Security assignment 1

Hanyang University Computer Software Department

## subject
- using symmetry key algorithm for encryption
- using hash function(I used hash256).
- using RSA encryption and make it be able to get input size of key.


## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Language: Python 3.9

## Run
`~$ python3 practice1.py`

## Steps to work
1. input plain text to encrypt
2. input key string to use for encryption in 32 bytes long
3. you can check its cipher text and decrypted text.
	and also check the hash value of key which you registered.
4. next step, you have to input integer value of key to encrypt your message
	on RSA system.
5. you can check cipher text encrypted by RSA and plain text decrypted.


'imgs/100bytes_plain_text.png': It works with 100bytes plain text well.

'imgs/temporal_plain_text.png': It works with temporary plain text well too.

'imgs/hangeul_support.png': It works with string of Hangeul well also.
